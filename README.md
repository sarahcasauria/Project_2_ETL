### Career Connection 

Each week, the students will review a Career Connection document in the [04-Career-Modules folder](../../04-Career-Modules/). This Career Connection relates this week's material to a professional setting, encourages students to complete certain career-focused tasks, and provides technical interviewing questions, where applicable, that the student can work through.

**Remember to push this entire folder for students to access.**
